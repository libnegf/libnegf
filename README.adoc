libNEGF
=======

libNEGF is a general library for Non Equilibrium Green's Functions.

With libNEGF you can calculate Equilibrium and Non Equilibrium Green's Function in open systems
and related quantities, within an efficient sparse iterative scheme.

libNEGF is available under LGPL license.

Have a look at the link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contributor's guide] if you want to help developing libNEGF.

For an example of application, see the use of libNEGF in https://dftbplus.org[DFTB+].

== Installation

libNEGF requires

* CMake,
* a C99 compiler,
* a Fortran 2018 compiler,
* BLAS,
* LAPACK, and
* MPI 3.

Optionally CUDA can be used.

Note that MPICH version 4 may cause build problems due to the mpifx dependency, see https://github.com/dftbplus/mpifx/issues/48[mpifx#48]. Moreover it is recommended to use recent gfortran releases: gfortran 11 and 12 are known to work, gfortran 10.2.1 (found in Debian 11) and GCC 8.3.0 (found in Debian 10) are known _not_ to work.

Running the tests additionally requires git-lfs for downloading test inputs.
The extension of test input files is `.dat`.


== Running the Tests on a Supercomputer

On some HPC systems (e.g., LUMI), front-end nodes do not feature GPUs or the front-end nodes may
have an instruction set architecture different from compute nodes (e.g., on Fugaku with its Intel
front-end and Arm64FX compute nodes). On these systems, it is best to submit all tests to the batch scheduler.

This can be achieved with the following steps. First, determine the account name and a queue (or _partition_) for job submission. Next, select a time limit. Tests that do not possess the label `long` run quickly even on personal computers. Therefore, we suggest a time limit of at most five minutes (this is per task). Finally, determine the number of MPI tasks within the job. Our recommendation is to run on at most one node with one job per NUMA domain.

CAUTION: Avoid large numbers of MPI tasks (e.g., by launching one task per virtual CPU core). The tests may not scale very well.

With the values above in mind, set `MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE` to the absolute path to the batch scheduler executable and have `MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS` contain all the batch scheduler arguments. Here is an example for Slurm:
```sh
cmake \
  -DLIBNEGF_TEST_WITH_MPIEXEC=ON \
  -DMPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE="$(which srun)" \
  -DMPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG='--ntasks' \
  -DMPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS=4 \
  -DMPIEXEC_PREFLAGS='--account=jsc1 --partition=dev --nodes=1 --time=5m' \
  ...
```



== Generating libNEGF Input

To create libNEGF input, obtain Slater-Koster parameterizations{empty}footnote:[J. C. Slater and G. F. Koster: "`Simplified LCAO Method for the Periodic Potential Problem`". 1954. Physical Review 94 (1498). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRev.94.1498.] for the molecule at hand (e.g., from the https://dftb.org/parameters/[DFTB+ Parameters] page) and describe the geometric properties of the molecule and its contacts. The description file format as well as visualization of input and output are described in details in the DTFB+ recipes document https://dftbplus-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transport/setup-geometry.html[_Setup Geometry utility_].
